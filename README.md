** manifesto **

the idea is that the main page is a list of all the stuff, catalogued by order of release, like a label. the content might be mixes elsewhere, pages within the zine, anything really. the pages will all be different every time, designed and built by hand

I want to emphasise the weirdness, fun, playfulness and personality that used to be inherent on the web but now is sadly hard to find due to templated content etc
